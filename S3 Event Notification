Configure S3 Event Notification with SNS and Email

Here I am setting up an S3 bucket notification that will send me an email whenever a new file is uploaded.

Step 1: Creating an S3 bucket
Creating a new bucket (in my case: img-stg121)

Step 2: creating an SNS topic and subscription
creating a topic (in my case: S3-event-notification)
creating a subscription for this topic with protocol = Email and add your email address

Check your email inbox and confirm the subscription by clicking the confirmation link

Step 3: Attach an access policy to SNS topic
Go to the SNS topic â†’ Edit â†’ Access policy
Replace the Resource ARN with your topic ARN
Replace the Source ARN with your S3 bucket ARN

Hereâ€™s the policy I used:

{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "example-ID",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Allows an S3 bucket to Publish events",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sns:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:256207368585:S3-event-notification",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::img-stg121"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Step 4: Configure S3 Event Notification
Go to S3 bucket â†’ Properties
Scroll down to Event notifications â†’ creating event
Select the event type (e.g., PUT for new uploads)
Select the SNS topic as the destination

Step 5: Upload a file and test
Upload a test file (I uploaded test-image.jpg) to the S3 bucket

Check your email inbox â†’ You should receive a notification email from SNS confirming the upload
